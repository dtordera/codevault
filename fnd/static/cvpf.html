                        Although my academic life &amp; unfinished careers, there was another passion that went parallel to my 'official' studies: coding. Begin to code at age of 13 with Spectrum 48k, in Basic. I kept my self-teaching at my secondary teaching phase, as in college, programming in Borland C 3.1, using the Scene techniques of the moment (raytracing, mode 13h, mode x, begins of 3D, pointers, structures, etc), applying learned math, and as well begin to move in telemathics (remember that in that time there was no internet, just BBSs). It continued in my College phase when I begin to move to visual languages as Delphi or PowerBuilder and database/SQL working (both, OOP, visual and SQl was just then widely applied). In fact, here I begin to sell some of my Delphi programs to real small business (one of them are still working/used at today by that business, with more than 15 years of contiuous work without maintenance)<br> Somebody can though that if I like to coding why not then I choose Computer Science as career. Again, please note that in that epoch (the 90's) Computer Science was just exploding here in Spain: there was no real career of computer science, and when it appears, anyway, it's teachings were really basics (internet were not widely spread in Spain until 1998 aproximately)<br>
                        So, then, with my autoteaching I kept a good level on C (and on &amp; 8086 asm), that I think are the best languages for a real good basis on programming.<br>
                        I had discovered recently that this way of autolearning (searching one for himself how to do anything had seen, that's it, using self-creating algorithms, headbreaking for specific problems, limited access to documentantion, no internet, etc, ...) had provided to me a waste way to detect &amp; to solve problems that, for example, a career-coming professional doesn't got at first.<br>

Using 3D &amp; WAD files from DOOM's Game Engine (at that time OpenGL specifications were too much insufficient)<br>

            <h3>Professional life brief</h3>
                        
                        My professional life (of cualified works) began at summer of 2001, where I was working as junior coder in a 3D C game project, at Compumatic Research S.L., Sant Cugat. We use there Linux, gcc &amp; Aurora as editor, and perform a modification of DOOM game WAD files (terrain files) &amp; 3D texturing engine: project was a 3D car game to teach kids the basis of driving. <br>
                        From next year, 2002, until aprox 2011, due my knowledgement of computer science, 3D, and architecture, and drawing options, I begin to work as draftsman for different architectural offices. There I use Autocad, programming concrete macros for administration (Visual Basic in Excel, Access) and tools in Autocad itself (AutoLisp). As well, knowledgement of 3D techniques let me to draw good 3D simulations and to solve day-of problems, optimizing rendering systems &amp; plottering ones; as well, the use of my coded tools allowed to avoid wasting time in rutinary tasks, etc, making improvements in the general work-flow of the office.<br>
                        Sadly, there was a general construction crisis on 2011, as well that internals problems in the last office I was working (Pilar Gimeno Arquitectes, Lloret de Mar) I left work and decide to migrate to code jobs again.<br>
                <h3>CSQ. Nowadays</h3>
                        
                        One year and a half later, during latest economical spanish crisis, I moved to Barcelona, where I found job as coder at CSQ Non Stop Shops, a very well positioned topup/payment business in Spain , South America &amp; U.S.A. My first duties were the mainteinance of the backend platform &amp; the development of modules to consume online international providers APIs. As this business it's focused on online topups &amp; electronical money, the quantity of communication tasks it's really big, and there was so the chance to work with the big telephony operators of the moment, and so, with the big electronical communication foundations (Telefonica, Orange, LycaMobile, Paysafecard, etc). From there I had been growing in the company, learning really a lot, and begining to be actual subdirector of technical department (from 3 years right now), project/team manager, analyst &amp; API architech for the different solutions in the business, etc.<br>
                        My current duties are, basically: <br><br>
                        -&nbsp;To design API layer for our customer wholesalers/distributors consupmtion (understand it as the API layer that POS machines consume, or customer web pages, or backend platforms). <br>
                        -&nbsp;To analyze new projects/scenarios that come and manage teams for new developments if in need, or to adapt existing ones to them, integrating them in our current system.<br>
                        -&nbsp;To prepare the modules for our providers API consumption<br>
                        -&nbsp;To visualize next steps for IT+D department, and prepare the best situation when it arrives.<br>
                        -&nbsp;As technical recruiter, interviewer<br>
                        -&nbsp;As level 0 for issues/outages/problems.<br> 
                        -&nbsp;As well, and not less, as we are a multinational corporation, to teach to code to resources that perhaps haven't got same oportunities as european/USA ones, giving then more independency to other countries corp teams.<br>
                        -&nbsp;All low-level communication/programming analysis<br><br>
                        Basically, all that what goes to low level.<br>
                        As you can see, my current job it's really interesting, and an everyday challenge, as for the technical point of view, and as for the international character of the corporation.                         
                        
                        My main current duties are focused on backend communications, and they are, indeed, growing a lot. Scabality, stability &amp; easy deployment are right now I'm then investigating with complex systems tools to manage microservices, as can be Spring Framework, Hystrix, Nginx, etc. As well, we had found a lot of times limitations of standard SQL Databases, the most the need of regular structure, and server's disponibility, so investigating with MongoDB and similar NoSQL tools.<br>
                        At front-end, as always had personally liked 3D representation, I'm currently investigating personally with Three.js and WebGL.

            <h3>Samples</h3>                        
            
                        You can see some samples of my work in my personal coding blog, https://www.davidscodevault.com. There are some examples about how work antique graphic techniques in modern languages (double-buffering example, 'fire effect', 'plasma effect', ...), explanation of some algorithms (diamond-square, deep-search, ...), and some sandbox (three.js),etc. It refers too to https://davidscodevault.com/running-examples/.
                        All sandbox code is in https://www.github.com/dtordera, freely accessible for all. There is too a first attempt for an universal transactional platform, a personal project for a sales backend platform, easy to configure via web interface, and enough flexible to allow new business models &amp; products &amp; business rules without a big effort. 
                        There's as well an online curriculum vitae on http://vps264757.ovh.net/cv.html
